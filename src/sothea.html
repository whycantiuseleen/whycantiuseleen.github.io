                            <p>Due to the political unrest in Cambodia, adminstration
                            of the national record was not properly done during those periods and
                            hence there is a lack of centralised national records for identification. 
                            This makes the medical health screenings in Cambodian villages highly 
                            inefficient as numerous man hours are often wasted on the retrieval of 
                            medical histories as well as on identifying both new and revisiting patients.  
                    
                            To alleviate this problem, a medical database was set up by SUTD Makerspace 
                            with an accompanying web application for the NUS medical students who 
                            provides free health screenings for the Cambodians annually. 
                            </p>
            
                            <p>However, there were negative feedbacks from the medical students regarding
                                the web application and hence the team will be looking into redesigning this 
                                web application to help ease their pain points.

                            <p>Since there were feedback regarding the dropouts 
                                during the screening process due to the short-attention 
                                span that the Cambodians have, one of our project goals was 
                                hence to <b>shorten the total time taken for the 
                                whole screening process</b>. This means that we had to focus 
                                on <b>shortening the time taken for the form-filling</b> and to 
                                <b>increase Doctor-Patient interaction so that the patients 
                                will feel engaged in the session itself</b>. We also aimed 
                                to <b>reduce cognitive load for the users</b>,
                                allowing them to focus better for each session.
