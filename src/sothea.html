                            <p>Due to the political unrest in Cambodia, adminstration
                            of the national record was not properly done during those periods and
                            hence there is a lack of centralised national records for identification. 
                            This makes the medical health screenings in Cambodian villages highly 
                            inefficient as numerous man hours are often wasted on the retrieval of 
                            medical histories as well as on identifying both new and revisiting patients.  
                    
                            To alleviate this problem, a medical database was set up by SUTD Makerspace 
                            with an accompanying web application for the NUS medical students who 
                            provides free health screenings for the Cambodians annually. 
                            </p>
            
                            <p>However, there were negative feedbacks from the medical students regarding
                                the web application and hence the team will be looking into redesigning this 
                                web application to help ease their pain points.

                                span that the Cambodians have, one of our project goals was 
                                hence to <b>shorten the total time taken for the 
                                whole screening process</b>. This means that we had to focus 
                                on <b>shortening the time taken for the form-filling in medical 
                                stations</b> and to <b>increase Doctor-Patient interaction so

                                users</b>, allowing them to focus better for each session.

                                        features to be displayed for the doctor's user flow. For me, 
                                        I have identified the following features to be displayed:

                                        and medical history before starting a new session.

                        of the usual "Next" or "Back" buttons. This allows us to remove these
                        elements from the screen and maximizes the questionare buttons allowing
                        users to fully focus on interacting with their patient with minimal

                        understand from our user's perspective that there are situations whereby
