                            <p>Aerial Defence is an interactive multiplayer 
                                game developed by taking inspiration from 
                                the 1930s pencil and paper game "The Battleships". 
                                It is a digital remake with the introduction 
                                of role-playing characters that is designed to 
                                hold unique abilities and it is also a competitive 
                                multiplayer turn based game.</p>

                                <p>Since the original "Battleships" was mainly a luck-based
                                    game, the team wanted to remake the game in order to introduce
                                    strategic thinking elements so as to make the game more diverse
                                    and exciting for the players. We wanted to provide game mechanics
                                    that will allow players to have a totally new experience for 
                                    each round of gameplay as they will have to weigh the pros and cons
                                    of each action that is taken.
                                </p>

                                <p>From there, we decided to develop a RPG which will introduce randomness
                                    and hence multiple approaches towards each round. Each character that
                                    was introduced into the game have specific roles and abilities that will
                                    significantly turn the tables of the game at any point.
                                </p>

                                    <p>Some considerations that I had when designing for the user's
                                        experience include the fact that the game is hosted on a 
                                        mobile platform. Coupled with our survey results whereby the 
                                        majority of the possible playerbase will usually play this game
                                        while on the go. This means that we had to consider for the fact
                                        that a single-handed navigation would be more suitable unless
                                        there is too much controls required which was the reason behind
                                        the usage of portrait mode for the game's orientation.

                                    <p>From our initial user-testing, we also observed that most people
                                        were unsure of their course-of-action due to the lack of pointers
                                        and subtle guides. As such, prompts were added when the
                                        system detects that players have been in idle mode for a period of
                                        time. The prompts also helped in the onboarding process as it
                                        educates and reminds players of the abilities that each character
                                        has.

                        most individuals could easily pick up the game after a brief introduction
                        on the basic game mechanics of the original game. 3 out of 10
                        individuals went on to play their second game which is considered successful
                        as most gamers will give up on a game quickly if it was difficult for 
                        them to navigate.
